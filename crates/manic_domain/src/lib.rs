//! ## What is it?
//!
//! Dexios-Domain is a library used for managing the core logic behind Dexios, and any applications that require easy integration with the Dexios format.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! Dexios-Domain is built on top of Dexios-Core - which uses modern, secure and audited<sup>1</sup> AEADs for encryption and decryption.
//!
//! You may find the audits for both AES-256-GCM and XChaCha20-Poly1305 on [the NCC Group's website](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/26/public-report-rustcrypto-aes-gcm-and-chacha20poly1305-implementation-review/).
//!
//! <sup>1</sup> Deoxys-II-256 does not have an official audit, so use it at your own risk
//!
//! ## Who uses Dexios-Domain?
//!
//! This library is implemented by [Dexios](https://github.com/brxken128/dexios), a secure command-line file
//! encryption utility.
//!
//! This crate was made to separate the logic away from the end-user application.
//!
//! It also allows for more things to be built on top of the core functionality, such as a GUI application.
//!
